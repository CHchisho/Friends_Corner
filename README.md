# Friends Corner

I enjoyed working with FastAPI the most, so I used it to build a small "Friends Corner" app to showcase my skills. 
It features user registration and authentication using cookies and JWTs. Users can then search for matching friend candidates.
If two users mutually "like" each other, they unlock a chat page powered by WebSockets. All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. 
I containerized the app with Docker and deployed it to Render so you can try it out yourself!


**This project demonstrates my ability to:**

- **Build an end-to-end web application with FastAPI**
- **Implement authentication and authorization**
- **Create a WebSocket chat feature**
- **Working with PostgreSQL and SQL databases**
- **Containerize apps with Docker**
- **Deploy to a cloud provider**
